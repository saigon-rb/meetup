# Ruby Meetup

Ruby Tuesday is a monthly meet-up, conducted on the first Tuesday of every month.

This is a space for everyone, beginners and guru experts alike, to share knowledge as well as learn from each other. 

A casual meet-up, always free, with unlimited coffee and tea and a bunch of brains to challenge what you already know.
