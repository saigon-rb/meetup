# Ruby Meetup

Ruby Tuesday is a bi-monthly Ruby meetup, conducted on the first Tuesday of every two month. This is a space for everyone, beginners and guru experts alike, to share knowledge as well as learn from each other. 

A casual meet-up, always free to attend, with unlimited coffee and tea and a bunch of brains to challenge what you already know.

The language of the talks will be decided depending on our speakers and inform in advance on the Meetup topic information.

If you want to code a little and exchange ideas, please bring your laptop! üòâ
